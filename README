                 Release of version 1.06 of Class::Delegation
==============================================================================


NAME
    Class::Delegation - Object-oriented delegation

DESCRIPTION
    The Class::Delegation module simplifies the creation of delegation-based
    class hierarchies, allowing a method to be redispatched:
	    * to a single nominated attribute,
	    * to a collection of nominated attributes in parallel, or
	    * to any attribute that can handle the message.

    These three delegation mechanisms can be specified for:
	    * a single method
	    * a set of nominated methods collectively
	    * any as-yet-undelegated methods
	    * all methods, delegated or not.
